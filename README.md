## Showcase App
### Introduction
The idea behind this project is to list all other collaborative projects in a web app that is offline capable and is built using modern web platform features. A user can see a list of cards with details about all other collaborative projects under [Udacity's Mobile Web Scholarship](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/) program. This list can be filtered/sorted based on categories and different features that the listed projects use. Users can see detailed info for projects by clicking on an individual card and see live experience as well.

### Stack
We've decided to use _MERN_ stack in our project. That means we'll be using [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node](http://nodejs.org/) to build our entire architecture.
For the PWA related functionalities, we've decided to build the prod SW file with CRA itself but we've tried our best to separate those source files into Vanilla javascript modules so that anyone not familiar with React or CRA but have completed the full course can contribute easily to the project.

### How to Contribute
The best way to get started with contributing is to identify a feature, bug or module that is [open for contributions](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app/labels/open%20for%20claim). Non-code contributions are also counted. You can contribute by helping people on issues board (for ex. someone is having trouble setting the repository and running app or any other queries).
For code style and commit guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Design Guidelines
A [Design Guideline](.github/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) has been created for reference. Please refer to it while making changes in UI.

### Project Set Up 
Open folder you want to clone this repo into, then-
* Frontend
    * `git clone https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app.git`
    * `cd showcase-app`
    * `yarn install` - to install project dependencies
    * `yarn start` - to run development build
    * `yarn build` - to build prod release
    * `yarn test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

> Note: the front end app is bootstrap using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more details about architecture [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). See [Project Wiki Page](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app/wiki/Client-Project-set-up).

* Backend
 //TODO: init proj and add docs

### How to use styles or SASS
1. Just run the development environment or production environment as usual with npm start and npm run build.
2. Create your SCSS files with an extension .scss and start writing SASS e.g. Button.scss.
3. While importing, use import './Button.css' (important since this is how it's done in CRA)

**Note**: We're ignoring `*.css` files by default because they will automatically be generated. So, if you try to add CSS files, you will not see them in the git status.
